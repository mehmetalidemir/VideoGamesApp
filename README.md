## About The Project


This application uses the RAWG.io API to provide users with access to a selection of video games. Users can filter the list of games by genre, search for games by name, view game details, and add games to their favorites list. Users can view game details such as the name, image, genre, release date, and number of reviews. The application also allows users to add notes to games and view their added notes. The app also supports notifications to alert users when a note is successfully sent. The application utilizes Core Data to store the userâ€™s notes. The layout and design of the app is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly and easily find the information they need.


## Built With

The application is built using the Swift language and used the Swift Package Manager for managing dependencies. The user interface is designed using Storyboards. Core Data is used to provide data persistence, which allows the app to save and retrieve data even when closed. The Model-View-ViewModel design pattern is used to separate the data and logic of the application from the visual elements, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase.
